For this project, I analyzed electric vehicle adoption in Washington using data from catalog.data.gov. I began by thoroughly cleaning and preparing the data for use in Tableau. I then created a series of visualizations to uncover key trends and insights. I started with a bar chart to show annual sales trends, breaking the data down by vehicle type with clear color coding. Next, I mapped the distribution of electric vehicles across Washington, using borders and bubbles to highlight areas of high activity. I also analyzed the top 10 counties for electric vehicle sales by creating a set in Tableau and visualizing the results in a bar chart. To dive deeper, I built a hierarchical bar chart to explore sales by vehicle make and model, incorporating calculated fields and parameters to allow interactive filtering. Finally, I crafted a dynamic donut chart using dual pie charts and calculated fields to present additional insights in a visually engaging way. These visualizations provided a comprehensive view of electric vehicle trends in Washington and allowed me to uncover actionable insights.
